## Inspiration
We were inspired by the app "Acorns" which rounds up purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the change. We wanted to take this idea and apply it to a more social cause. We wanted to create an application that would allow users to donate to charities that they care about without having to think about it.

## What it does
JustChange is a service that rounds purchases that a user makes every time they swipe their credit card. To choose which organizations to donate to the app gives you the option of either being presented with charities in a “Tinder-style” fashion where the user can swipe right on the charities that they want to give to and left on the ones that they do not, or by searching directly. Finally, at the end of the year, statistics about the user’s generosity are compiled into a succinct and shareable “Spotify Wraped-style” image so the user can post on social media the causes that they are supporting for the year. 

## How we built it
We created this project using React, MySQL, and a bit of Python. We used React to create the general webpage and implement most functions. We used MySQL to store user data and donation data. We used Python to generate the social media repostable image. We would use the Plaid API to get the user’s transactions and chagre them monthly based on the number of transactions they make. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a few challenges when pushing our idea to production. Only one of our group members was fluent in React and we struggled to get the other members up to speed. This is also the first Hackathon that most of our team has been too and we were somewhat unprepared for the amount of work that we would have to do.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are most proud of our idea and how we were all able to brainsotrm and come up with a solution that we all liked. We are also proud of the fact that we were able to delagate work properly and get the project done in the time that we had.

## What we learned
We learned how to use React and how to time manage more effectively. We also learned how to work as a team and how to delegate work. We also learned how to present our technologies as a tech demo.

## What's next for JustChange
Our next step is to fully integrate all of our technologies together and fully launch our aplication onto the web. Our next next steps are to migrate our product over to a mobile application to better reach our user and apeal to a larger audience.
